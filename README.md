!WIP!

This is the repository for our School of Code full-stack final project. More information will be added here as the project progresses. 

About the project:

We are building an a web-app that aids groups of people to make a decision on what social activity they would like to do, for example, which resturant they would like to go to. It is a real-time voting app that filters results based on user votes. The end-result is a single suggestion made by the app for example, a specific resturant. 
We aim to launch the product by the start of July.
